## 💳 Business Problem
Credit card fraud costs the global payments industry over $32 billion annually, with losses projected to exceed $43 billion by 2028.

For a mid-sized bank processing 10 million transactions per day, even a 0.1% fraud rate translates to 10,000 fraudulent transactions daily — amounting to millions in chargebacks, investigation costs, and customer churn.

Financial institutions face three competing pressures:


| Challenge | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Real-time detection** | A fraudulent transaction must be flagged within milliseconds, before payment is authorised |
| **Minimize false positives** | 32% of customers abandon a card after just one false decline |
| **Class imbalance** | Fraud represents less than 0.2% of all transactions — traditional classifiers fail silently |
| **Model Performance** | High precision and recall are critical to balance detection with user experience |

## Who This Solves For

| Stakeholder | Why They Care |
| :--- | :--- |
| Banks & Payment Processors | Reduce chargebacks, meet PCI-DSS compliance, protect customer trust |
| E-commerce Platforms | Minimize payment fraud, reduce manual review queues |
| FinTech Startups | Deploy production-grade detection without building ML infrastructure |
| Insurance Companies | Apply same anomaly detection patterns to claims fraud |
---
## 🧠 Solution Overview
This project implements a dual-model fraud detection architecture that mirrors real-world production systems:

* __Random Cut Forest (RCF)__— Unsupervised anomaly detector. Catches novel, never-before-seen fraud patterns without labeled data.
* __XGBoost + SMOTE__ — Supervised classifier trained on historical fraud labels. Recognizes known fraud signatures with high precision.
Combining both provides __defense__ in depth: XGBoost catches fraud that looks like past fraud; RCF catches fraud that looks like nothing legitimate.

## Business Requirements Met

| # | Requirement | Target | Achieved |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Real-time scoring | < 100ms | ✅ |
| 2 | High recall on fraud | ≥ 80% | ✅ 80% |
| 3 | High precision | ≥ 90% | ✅ 93% |
| 4 | Scalability | 10,000+ TPS | ✅ SageMaker auto-scaling |
| 5 | Audit logging | Every prediction logged | ✅ Kinesis → S3 |
| 6 | Reproducible infra | One-click deploy | ✅ CloudFormation |

## 📊 Dataset
ULB Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset — Kaggle
| Attribute | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| Records | 284,807 transactions |
| Features | 30 (Time, V1–V28 PCA-transformed, Amount) |
| Fraud cases | 492 (0.172% of total) |
| Time period | Two days of European cardholder transactions, September 2013 |
| Privacy | V1–V28 are PCA-transformed to protect cardholder identity |

> ⚠️ The dataset (`creditcard.csv`, 143 MB) is excluded from this repository due to GitHub's file size limit. Download it from [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com) and place it at `notebooks/creditcard.csv`.

## 🤖 Models
__1. XGBoost + SMOTE (Primary Classifier)__
XGBoost is trained on labeled transaction data with SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) applied to address the severe class imbalance (0.172% fraud).

Key hyperparameters:
```python
max_depth         = 5
eta               = 0.2
subsample         = 0.8
scale_pos_weight  = 1  # overridden by SMOTE rebalancing
objective         = binary:logistic
num_round         = 150
```
## 2. Random Cut Forest (Anomaly Detector)
An unsupervised model that learns the statistical structure of normal transactions and flags deviations — enabling detection of **new fraud patterns never seen during training.**
```python
num_trees        = 50
num_samples_per_tree = 256
feature_dim      = 30
```
## Why Two Models?

| | XGBoost | Random Cut Forest |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Type** | Supervised | Unsupervised |
| **Learns from** | Labeled fraud history | Statistical normality |
| **Catches** | Known fraud patterns | Novel, unseen anomalies |
| **Weakness** | Blind to new attack vectors | Higher false positive rate |
| **Strength** | High precision on known fraud | Future-proof coverage |

## 📈 Model Performance
Evaluated on a held-out test set (20% of 284,807 transactions):


| Metric | Base XGBoost | XGBoost + SMOTE | Improvement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Precision** | 91% | **93%** | +2% |
| **Recall** | 78% | **80%** | +2% |
| **F1 Score** | 84% | **86%** | +2% |
| **AUC-ROC** | ~0.97 | **~0.98** | +0.01 |
| **F2 Score** | 71% | **83%** | +12% |

> At 10M daily transactions, a +2% recall improvement catches thousands of additional fraudulent transactions per day.

The architecture transfers directly to other imbalanced classification problems:

🏥 Medical diagnosis — rare disease detection from patient records
🔒 Network intrusion detection — anomaly-based cybersecurity
🚗 Insurance claims fraud — same dual-model pattern
⚙️ Predictive maintenance — equipment failure from sensor data
